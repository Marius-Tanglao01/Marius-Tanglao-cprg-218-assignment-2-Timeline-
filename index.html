            These X/Twitter header designs were one of the early phases of my
            wonderful journey in graphic design. I had zero connections and zero
            clients. What did I do? I created passion projects to gain some
            design friends and to improve my skills. These header designs were
            made for some of my favorite designers and artists. As you can see,
            they are unified with one style. This is basically a graphic design
            style I made up called “Core.” This design style was originally made
            in a video game called “Geometry Dash” which I was super addicted
            to. The style is characterized by maximalist shapes, technology
            assets, and bold gradients. Around February 2022, I got the idea of
            putting the Geometry Dash art style into graphic design. This opened
            the floodgates of me using it again and again, refining it after
            each new project, until people on Twitter associated me with that
            style. The designs on the left are the first core-styled headers I
            made for some designers I admired namely @H3ADB0T, @MikaeliFX, and
            @MindCap.
